During this assignment, I worked with both Dash and Streamlit. They both help create interactive dashboards, but in different ways. 
Streamlit is easier to start with — you write a line and see the result right away. 
Dash takes more setup but gives you more control, especially for layout and callbacks.

Dashboards are a great way to show data so non-technical users can explore it. 
I made a chart for different countries and saw how quickly you can switch and compare GDP. 
That’s really helpful when working with changing data.

The difference between static and interactive charts became clear: 
a static chart shows only one view, while an interactive one lets users explore the data themselves. 
That’s important when you’re building a tool, not just a report.

Dash and Plotly make the data feel alive — you can filter, hover, and change options without reloading the page. 
It’s useful and looks professional when sharing results with clients or a team.

Streamlit feels perfect for quick tests and personal tools. 
Dash works better for more advanced apps, especially if you want to deploy them online.
